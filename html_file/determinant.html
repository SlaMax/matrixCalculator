            <h2>Determinant</h2>
            <p>The determinant of a matrix is a single numerical value which is used when calculating the inverse or
                when solving systems of linear equations. The determinant of a matrix A is denoted |A|, or sometimes
                det(A).
                The determinant is only defined for square matrices.
                There are several different methods for solving determinants, such as Laplace expansion:</p>

            <h2>Matrix norm</h2>
            <p>A matrix norm is a number defined in terms of the entries of the matrix. The norm is a useful
                quantity which can give important information about a matrix.</p>
            <p>The norm of a square matrix A is a non-negative real number denoted ||A||. There are several
                different ways of defining a matrix norm, but they all share the following properties:
            <p>1. ||A|| ≥ 0 for any square matrix A.</p>
            <p>2. ||A|| = 0 if and only if the matrix A = 0.</p>
            <p>3. ||kA|| = |k| ||A||, for any scalar k.</p>
            <p>4. ||A + B|| ≤ ||A|| + ||B||.</p>
            <p>5. ||AB|| ≤ ||A|| ||B||.</p>
            The norm of a matrix is a measure of how large its elements are. </p>
            <p>This is the formula for 2.norm:</p>

            <h2>Trace of a matrix</h2>
            <p>The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix. It is a fundamental concept
                in linear algebra and has various applications in mathematical and applied fields. The trace of a matrix
                is widely used in physics to calculate the expectation values of operators in quantum mechanics. In
                statistics, it measures the total variability of a dataset when applied to covariance matrices.</p>

            <h2>Rank of a matrix</h2>
            <p>The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. It is
                denoted as rank(A), where A is the matrix.
                The rank is used in various fields such as:<br>
                - Linear algebra: To determine the solution space of linear systems.<br>
                - Data science: In dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.<br>
                - Engineering and physics: To analyze the behavior of systems of equations.<br>
                - Computer graphics: For transformations and projections.
            </p>

            <h2>The transpose of a matrix</h2>
            <p>The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix obtained by swapping its rows and columns.
                It is denoted as Aᵀ, where A is the original matrix.
                For a matrix A with elements aᵢⱼ, the transpose Aᵀ has elements aⱼᵢ.<br>
                The transpose is used in:<br>
                - Linear algebra: To work with matrix operations and vector spaces.<br>
                - Computer graphics: For transformations and rotation matrices.<br>
                - Data science: In operations like data reshaping or transposing datasets.<br>
                - Physics and engineering: In systems involving multiple dimensions or coordinates.<br>

            <h2>Inverse of a matrix</h2>
            <p>The inverse of a matrix is a matrix, denoted as A⁻¹, such that when it is multiplied by the original
                matrix A, it results in the identity matrix:<br>

                A × A⁻¹ = A⁻¹ × A = I<br>

                where I is the identity matrix.
                The inverse exists only for square matrices with a non-zero determinant.<br>
                It is used in:<br>
                - Solving linear systems: To find solutions using matrix equations.<br>
                - Engineering and physics: For systems modeling and transformations.<br>
                - Computer graphics: For coordinate transformations and scaling.<br>
                - Optimization problems: To compute solutions efficiently.
